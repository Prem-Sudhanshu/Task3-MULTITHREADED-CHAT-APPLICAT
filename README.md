## Task 3 focuses on building a client-server chat application using Java Sockets and multithreading. This task introduces interns to the fundamentals of network programming and concurrent execution, which are essential skills for real-time communication systems.

The main goal is to create:

A server program that can handle multiple client connections simultaneously.

A client program that can send and receive messages from the server.

A multithreaded design where each connected client is managed through a separate thread, enabling real-time, two-way communication among users.

Interns will work with Javaâ€™s Socket, ServerSocket, InputStream, OutputStream, and Thread classes. The application should be able to:

Accept multiple clients without crashing or slowing down.

Allow clients to send messages to the server, which can then broadcast or relay them to other clients.

Display messages cleanly and clearly on the client side.

The deliverable is a fully functional chat system, demonstrating the use of sockets for connection and threads for concurrent user communication. The code should be well-organized, with clear comments and a basic protocol for sending and receiving messages.

This task is designed to give hands-on experience with:

Socket programming, which is foundational for all kinds of networking tasks.

Multithreading, which helps in managing concurrent processes effectively.

Building interactive systems like messaging apps, multiplayer games, and remote tools.

Interns should store their code in a GitHub repository and make sure the solution is properly documented. They are encouraged to use learning resources such as YouTube tutorials, Google, and ChatGPT to understand core networking and threading concepts.
